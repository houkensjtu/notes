** how to know what's installed?				 :debian:apt:
   1. dpkg --listfiles packagename
   2. dpkg --search filename
** where is DNS server/host configured?			  :debian:networking:
   1. /etc/resolv.conf <- DNS server
   2. /bin/hostname
** why .xinitrc doesnt work?					:debian:xorg:
   In xinitrc file, not only "xmodmap ~/.xmodmap", but also "exec ratpoison" is necessary.
Otherwise xorg maybe do not know which wm to startup so startx doesnt work out...
** how to view kernel version?				      :debian:kernel:
  uname -r

** org-mode and git-hub						:orgmode:git:
   Start using org-mode to take notes.
   Some important key-binding:
   
   Add tag: C-c C-c
   Add time stamp: C-c .

   About git-hub: I have an account bounding to my mailbox.
   Here is the flow to sync:
   1. git init
   2. git add filename
   3. git commit -m ""
   4. git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
   5. git push origin master
