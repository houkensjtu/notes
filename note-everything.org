** how to know what's installed?				 :debian:apt:
   1. dpkg --listfiles packagename
   2. dpkg --search filename
** where is DNS server/host configured?			  :debian:networking:
   1. /etc/resolv.conf <- DNS server
   2. /bin/hostname
** why .xinitrc doesnt work?					:debian:xorg:
   In xinitrc file, not only "xmodmap ~/.xmodmap", but also "exec ratpoison" is necessary.
Otherwise xorg maybe do not know which wm to startup so startx doesnt work out...
** how to view kernel version?				      :debian:kernel:
  uname -r
